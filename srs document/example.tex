\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Purpose}
The document is an official statement of what the system developers should implement. It includes both the user requirements for a system and a detailed specification of the system requirements. The document is essential for outside contractor who developing the software system. It is also useful to write a short supporting document that defines the business and dependability requirement for the system. The document is for system customers, managers, system engineers, system test engineers, system maintenance engineers.
\section{What are GitHub APPs?}
GitHub Apps are first-class actors within GitHub. A GitHub App acts on its own behalf, taking actions via the API directly using its own identity, which means you don't need to maintain a bot or service account as a separate user.\\
GitHub Apps can be installed directly on organizations and user accounts and granted access to specific repositories. They come with built-in webhooks and narrow, specific permissions. When you set up for your GitHub App, you can select the repositories you want it to access.\\
Some key ideas when creating GitHub Apps
\begin{enumerate}
	\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{{\textbf{\arabic{enumi}.}}}
	\item A GitHub App should take actions independent of a user (unless the app is using a user-to-server token).
	\item Make sure the GitHub App integrates with specific repositories.
	\item The GitHub App should connect to a personal account or an organization.
	\item Don't expect the GitHub App to know and do everything a user can.
	\item Don't use a GitHub App if you just need a "Login with GitHub" service. But a GitHub App can use a user identification flow to log users in and do other things.
	\item Don't build a GitHub App if you only want to act as a GitHub user and do everything that user can do.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Product Scope}
GitGroup is a web-based GitHub Application. It is a project management platform that allows everyone on your team to communicate with the developers. Therefore, GitGroup is not only designed for programmer but also for people who has less development experience such as project manager, project members and people who are related to the project. On GitGroup, it is easy to create an Agile workflow for your team with a kanban board. GitGroup?s seamless integration with GitHub keeps all of your GitHub Issue data in sync across both platforms in real time.
It is an easy access web-based application that served for product management team based on Github API.\\
GitGroup is built by several software development tools. From the perspective of programming language, we use both TypeScript and JavaScript. TypeScript is an open-source programming language.It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, and adds optional static typing to the language. And its strong Object-Oriented Programming features make it as a best developing language for building GitGroup. When the developing is done, TypeScript compiler can compile the source code to JavaScript program in order to let it run on the NodeJS. Javascript is a language which is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.\\
From the perspective of framework. ReactJS(Front end framework), Bulma(CSS framework), Frontawesome(Icon set and toolkit), ExpressJS(Back end framework) is chose. In the test process, our tool is Jest. It is a Javascript testing software. Jest is used by Facebook to test all JavaScript code including React applications. One of Jest's philosophies is to provide an integrated "zero-configuration" experience. This feature of Jest make the duration of developing shorter. Also we regard MongoDB as our host DBMS, which is one of the most popular database management tool. Other tools such as Git, Heroku, Visual Studio Code, Postman, are also included in developing process.\\

\section{Overview of The Document}
The rest of the document will include overall description of Gitgroup in following perspectives. Product perspective, product functions, user characteristics, operating environment, design and implementation constraints, assumptions and dependencies. For interface requirement, we put efforts on user interfaces, hardware interfaces, software interfaces and communications interfaces. we will also include requirements like user requirements, system requirements, functional requirements, non-functional requirements and system models like use case diagram, activity diagram, sequence diagram, class diagram, system architecture, web design. 

% Chapter 2 Overall Description
\chapter{Overall Description}
This section of the SRS will include general factors that affect the product and its requirements. This section does not state specific requirements. Instead, it provides a background for those requirements, which are defined in detail in Section 3 of the SRS, and makes them easier to understand. 
\section{Product Perspective}
The background of the Gitgroup coming from project managers are often busy to managing multiple projects at the same time. Sometimes, they are not familiar with details with products especially in technology perspective. However, Git and Github have a high entrance standard which project manager hard to manipulate it. For example, when you want to create an issue to suggest a new idea or track a bug, you need to learn markdown syntax, emoji code. And it is even more complex when you do pull request and merge the project. Comparing with Git and Github,   GitGroup is an easier access tool . People who has little development experience, such as product manager. They also can handle GitGroup easily. The only thing they need to do is sign up an account and access to the GitHub api. The user can create online group chat, schedual and resord conference. After finding project idea, our online app also provide the task management service. In each project, every user will have their own grade. Furthermore, the online web can have a recommendation system which help the product manager and programmer match each other. In conclusion, it is a online service based on the GitHub API, and improve the user experience. 
\section{Product Functions}
Our product focus on easy access, clearly, convenience, efficiency. Fuctions are surrounded our goals. Mainly function lists in the following.
\begin{enumerate}
	\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{{\textbf{\arabic{enumi}.}}}
	\item Online meeting: Online meeting group chat. Record the conference. Make conference scheduling form and alarming the coming meeting. 
	\item Task management: The function is Like GitHub task management, but Gitgroup has better UI design. Make TODO list also included in task management, users create an issue to suggest a new idea or track a bug by means of setting up a TODO list. Then user can organize and assign tasks to their team members. 
	\item Developer grading system: Record the working of any team member. According the performance of users in all team which he joined, get users a grade.
	\item Developer finding system: If you are a team leader, you can find a perfect developer who has related skill to your project. If you are a software developer, you can post your information to find suitable project for you.
\end{enumerate}

\section{TypeScript}
TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, and adds optional static typing to the language. \\
TypeScript is used to develop GitGroup because its strong Object-Oriented-Programming features.\\
TypeScript is designed for development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript.As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs. TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript applications for both client-side and server-side (Node.js) execution.\\
\section{mLab}
mLab is a fully managed cloud database service that hosts MongoDB databases. mLab runs on cloud providers Amazon, Google, and Microsoft Azure, and has partnered with platform-as-a-service providers. 
\section{MongoDB}
MongoDB is a free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with schemata. MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc., and is published under a combination of the Server Side Public License and the Apache License. 
\\
MongoDB is used via mLab in this project. And Mongoose is chosen as the ORM(Object-relational mapping).
\section{Express}
Express, a web server built on Node.js, forms the middle tier or the web server. It defines routes, specifications of what to do when a HTTP request matching a certain pattern arrives. The matching specification is regular expression (regex) based and is very flexible. The what-to-do part is just a function that is given the parsed HTTP request. Express parses request URL, headers, and parameters for us. On the response side, it has, as expected, all of the functionality required by web applications including setting response codes, setting cookies, sending custom headers, etc.  
\section{React}
React is a front-end technology from Facebook. It?s not a full-fledged MVC framework, but it?s a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, so in some sense it?s the view part of MVC. We use React to render a view because it tries to solve the problem from the View layer by creating abstract representations of views. It breaks down parts of the view in the Components. These components encompass both the logic to handle the display of view and the view itself. It can contain data that it uses to render the state of the app. 
\section{NodeJs}
NodeJs, a server-side JavaScript runtime environment, has an asynchronous eventdriven, non-blocking input/output (I/O) model, as opposed to using threads to achieve multitasking. It relies heavily on callbacks and promises to let you know that a pending task is completed. Node.js achieves multitasking using an event-loop. This is nothing but a queue of events that need to be processed and callbacks to be run on those events. An event-based approach also makes Node.js applications fast and lets the programmer be blissfully oblivious of the semaphores and locks that are utilized to synchronize multithreaded events.  
\section{Heroku}
Heroku is a cloud platform as a service (PaaS) supporting several programming languages. Heroku, one of the first cloud platforms, has been in development since June 2007, when it supported only the Ruby programming language, but now supports Java, Node.js, Scala, Clojure, Python, PHP, and Go.\\
In this project, Heroku is the platform where GitGroup is deployed to.
